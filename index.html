<h2 id="summary">1 SUMMARY</h2>
<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
<p>EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> is a new-age enterprise designed to provide investors with access to innovative and cutting-edge startups through our revolutionary syndication economy. our goal is to democratize access to potential unicorns to all eligible investors.<br /><br /> The syndication economy, powered by digital assets and secured and managed on a distributed ledger (the Ethereum blockchain and others), provides direct and indirect investment access and transparency.</p>
<p>We are focused on creating near-term (1 year +) liquidity through potential redemptions and long-term return on investment through value accretion.</p>
<p>We believe EDGE196<sup>&trade; </sup>investors will benefit from enhanced liquidity, improved risk distribution, and access to startups that have prevailed through a 3-tiered fundamental due diligence conducted by global experts.</p>
<p>We believe Startups will benefit from EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup>&rsquo;s 3-M&rsquo;s - EDGE196<sup>&trade; </sup>provides a strategic investment source for Money, industry-leading Mentorship from EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> global experts, and Market Access by direct introductions to global vendors and potential clients.</p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup>'s mission is to transform the dysfunctional, insider's club of venture capital investing to allow and encourage all eligible investors to participate on a level playing field. We strive to be a catalyst to unite startups, investors, and service providers, by opening avenues to a marketplace in a borderless ecosystem, and maximising value through the EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> syndication economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1 THE PROBLEM</h2>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>The venture capital market has many inefficiencies that lock-out investors and restrict access to capital for startups.</em></span><br /> <br /><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em> VC&rsquo;s position themselves as supporters, financiers, and even the instigators of innovation, yet the industry itself has been devoid of innovation for the past twenty years.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite vast numbers of businesses launching every year, most startups still fail for a number of reasons including:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Insufficient capital, and/or poorly timed capital raising</li>
<li>Management distraction from product development to raise capital</li>
<li>Misunderstanding the capital markets</li>
<li>Lack of effective leadership mentoring</li>
<li>Poor product marketing and sales</li>
<li>Inability to access global markets and/or supply chains</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The cost of failure of startups is generally borne by angel investors, who rely on the success of a small number of targeted investments to recoup losses on failed investments.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, investors spend an inordinate amount of time searching for, reviewing, and performing due diligence on a wide range of startups. With small capital, these investors must either be highly selective when making targeted investments with scarce dollars, or pay large fund fees to participate in diverse pools.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Sometimes, minimum investment requirements block smaller investors from opportunities which can cause them to miss out on lucrative opportunities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><br />THE CURRENT STATE OF THE STARTUP ECOSYSTEM</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Starting a new business is a daunting undertaking rife with peril. Despite the odds-against, many ambitious entrepreneurs accept this challenge at some time in their lives. While there are no precise sources to track the number of new startups, research suggests that there are tens of millions of startups at some stage of business development at any given moment in time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most great ideas and the businesses that they drive, however, never come to successful fruition. An analysis of startups (specifically high growth tech ventures), shows that 92% of them fail within the first three years (some investment firms claim to have lower failure rates).&nbsp; We believe that EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup>'s 3-Ms can provide a measurable, positive increase to a startup's potential for success.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><br />CHALLENGES FACING STARTUPS</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">There have been various research studies that have uncovered the reasons for the failure of startup companies. These studies cite several reasons, including lack of proper product-market fit, lack of productive team, and the inability to &ldquo;master the message.&rdquo; We believe that some entreprenuers lack general finance experience, some lack HR and other business management expertise, others can't gain access to necessary support services and customers. These challenges are interconnected, or sometimes precursors of the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">For example, when a startup struggles after hiring the wrong people, it is more likely to run out of cash before its products gain market acceptance.<br /> Another reason common failure is poor marketing and ineffective messaging. For instance, despite having a great idea, great product, a flawless sales platform can cause a startup to fail.<br /> <br /> Most failures can be summed up by saying that the startup runs out of cash before its products reach customer acceptance.</p>
<p>Many entrepreneurs invest their friends and family, to a greater or lesser extent, in the success of their projects.&nbsp; The failure of startups as a result of the challenges listed to the left not only impedes innovation and funding, it also hurts the friends and family who invest in the enterprise.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> If an entrepreneur passes the friends and family round, the next set of investors are usually angels and venture capitalists. These angels and VCs usually use a "shot gun" approach by taking small stakes in many startups and try to overcome the overwhelming failure percentages by riding heavy on the backs of the few successes the pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along the way, investors eager for success often become Impatient and apply counterproductive pressure on the startups.&nbsp; This pressure can cause startups to miss longer-dated opportunities.</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<h3>VENTURE CAPITAL MYTHS AND TRUTHS</h3>
<p>Diane Mulcahy, in a Harvard Business Review titled "Six Myths about Venture Capitalists", debunked the myths concerning VCs. Following are her main points:</p>
<p><em><strong>MYTH: VCs are often portrayed as risk-takers who back bold new ideas. <br /> <br /> TRUTH: While they do take risks, they risk their investors' capital and very little of their own.</strong> <br /> <br /> </em>In most VC funds, the sponsor's money often accounts for just 1% of the total. The industry's revenue model, long investment cycle, and lack of visible performance data make VCs less accountable for their performance than most other professional investors. What the VC risk is its reputation and track-record which if positive wins it more investor capital.<br /> <br /> The reason behind that is the standard VC fund charges an annual fee of 2% on committed or invested capital over the life of the fund, which is usually 10 years. <br /> <br /> Moreover, the VC enjoys a significant percentage of the profits upon successful exit, usually when a portfolio company is acquired or goes public.</p>
<p><em><strong><br />MYTH: VCs are believed to generate great returns on their investments. <br /> <br /> TRUTH: Research suggests that the overall performance of the industry is poor.</strong> <br /> <br /> </em>VC funds haven't significantly outperformed the public markets since the late 1990s, and particularly since 1997, due to less cash being returned to VC investors than what they have invested. <br /> <br /> There is a small group of top-performing firms that generate great &ldquo;venture rates of return&rdquo; at least twice the capital invested, net of fees. <br /> <br /> However, it's hard to know definitively which firms are in that group because performance data are not generally available and are not consistently reported.<em><br /> <br /> </em></p>
<h3><br />LACK OF VC INNOVATION</h3>
<p>On average, most VC funds breaks even or loses money. VCs position themselves as supporters, financers, and even breeding ground of innovation, yet the industry itself has been devoid of innovation for the past twenty years. <br /> <br /> Venture capital has seen plenty of changes over time - more capital input, bigger funds, and declining returns. But funds are structured, capital is raised, and partners are paid just as they were two decades ago.</p>
<p>Research by the Kauffman Foundation investment team dives deeper into the pain points of the Venture Capitalists globally. Their study analysed a twenty-year history of venture investing experience in nearly 100 VC funds with some of the most notable and exclusive partnership "brands". They concluded from the detailed study that the limited partner investment model is broken.</p>
<p>Limited Partners, including foundations, endowments, and state pension funds invest too much capital in underperforming venture capital funds on frequently misaligned terms.</p>
<h3><br />IS THERE ANY HOPE FOR STARTUPS?</h3>
<p>The inflexibility of venture capital funding paints a bleak picture for the future of startups. While avoiding failure altogether is impossible, historical high levels of failure and the inability of investors to connect with the right enterprises reflect the presence of systemic flaws in the startup and investment structure.</p>
<p>Another sad reality regarding the challenges of a new startup is that most face these challenges alone. While startup services such as mentoring, investment, marketing, research, legal, etc. are currently available, connecting startups and these services are passive and fragmented at best.</p>
<p>Many initiatives and organizations such as universities, accelerators, venture capital companies, and others try to help promising innovators and their businesses. These disjointed services are often expensive, with very little reliable information available for startups to make informed decisions regarding which of these services will be a good use for their limited resources (management attention and money)!<br /> <br /> Moreover, even though each of the above facilitators provide a piece of the solution, they are mostly disconnected from each other and fail to provide a holistic solution.<em> <br /></em><em><br /><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>EDGE196</strong><sup>&trade;</sup><strong> provides that holistic solution that connects innovators, growth companies, qualified investors skilled service providers and potential customers.</strong></span><br /> <br /> </em></p>
<h3>BUT&hellip;MANY STARTUPS DO SUCCEED</h3>
<p>&nbsp;In spite the strong headwinds, many startups are able to rise from the dust and soar high. The triumph of such startups is no surprise, given the combined effect of many success-inducing factors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;For instance, startups succeed when technology innovators are allowed to leverage successful business people through mechanisms of mentorship, advisory, and a repository of other services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Startup Genome report, initiated by Compass' E-commerce Genome, provides an in-depth analysis of data from more than 650 startups. One of the most evident results was that entrepreneurs who continued to learn were able to innovate and become more successful. Startups that had helpful mentors learned from other startups and leaders, and tracked metrics more effectively, raised 7x more money and had 3.5x better user growth.</p>
<p>Another important conclusion of the research was that many investors invested 2-3x more capital than necessary in startups that haven't reached their potential. They also overinvested in solo founders and founding teams without technical co-founders, despite indicators suggesting that these teams will have a much lower success rate.</p>
<p>This demonstrates that choosing the right investment opportunity is itself a challenging exercise. To maximize the chances of an investment to succeed, it will be wise to choose startups with the most potential for success and provide them with the best services and conditions to increase their chances of success.<br /><br /><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">We believe the EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> due diligence process identifies innovators with the greatest potential for success. As demonstrated here, if the right solutions are offered, the potential for long-term success is greatly increased.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. OUR SOLUTION</h3>
<p>EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> has created a global ecosystem which connects startups with investment (Money), Mentoring and Market access, and simultaneously providing access for investors to participate on a level playing field in tech startup investments. <br /> <br /> Two digital assets empower the entire ecosystem. Through EDGE-Q, EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> aims to provide venture capital investors with access to a pool of promising startups. <br /> <br /> EDGE-X offers holders access to our revolutionary EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> Ecosystem.</p>
<p>EDGE-Q participates in success of our investments by fractional ownership. EDGE-X allows EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> participants to access to the EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> Ecosystem for discounted services provided by our innovative companies and partners. <br /><em><br /><span style="color: #ff0000;">Focused on creating short-term and long-term value for investors, our mission is to make investing in unicorns available to everyone. EDGE-Q holders grow with our companies. EDGE-X holders get stable access to our services.</span><br /> <br /> <br /> </em></p>
<p>EDGE-Q allows investors to participate in our pool of vetted tech companies alongside founders' dollars.</p>
<p>EDGE-X Is accepted by all of our investee companies and our support partners.&nbsp; Goods and services can be purchased at preferential rates using EDGE-X.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> ecosystem utilizes digital assets, cryptographically secured on the Ethereum blockchain and others.</p>
<p>Purchasers can acquire EDGE-X directly from <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> via Genesis Sale and subsequent Momentum sales. EDGE-X is a liquidity bridge which serves as a transfer of value between holders and service providers.</p>
<p>Revenue raised from EDGE-Q sales is used to fund <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> investment in promising startups.</p>
<p>Startups apply to <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> for funding and undergo a rigorous 3-tier due diligence and vetting process. The winners will have access to <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> funding based on <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> approved business plans and budgets. Some of those that don&rsquo;t make the first cut will have access to <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> global mentors to allow them to refine their offering and potentially win funding approval in subsequent rounds.</p>
<p>Accordingly, EDGE-Q investors will see their investment spread across numerous projects, space, and time. Thus, instead of risking millions of dollars on an individual concept, investors may spread their investment risk over a highly selective portfolio of opportunities. <br /> <br /> Because <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> is a private firm, not a venture capital firm, it enables a much broader group of investors to participate in the kinds of unicorn level investment opportunities traditionally accessible only to deep-pocketed venture capital firms and financial institutions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> aims to place alongside major disruptors</span></p>
<p><em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> aims to disrupt the venture capital industry by creating an ecosystem of security, stability, and enhanced benefits for startups seeking funding, investors looking for suitable investments, and service providers willing to work with a highly-motivated and passionate group of entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> We envision a time when industry participants will regard <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> as the standard benchmark. No longer will investors accept opaque, centralized fund management, and disproportionately high cost and risk, for low to moderate returns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CONDITIONAL GENESIS OFFER CLOSURE</h3>
<p>The Genesis Offer will run until all allocated EDGE-X has been purchased, however the minimum subscription is set to 25% of the total (in other words 125,000,000 EDGE-X must be sold before EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> will release any EDGE-X. </p>
<p>In the event of less demand for the Genesis Offer, EDGE196<sup>&trade; </sup>may discontinue the sale upon 25% sales, and allocate the remaining EDGE-X to future Momentum Sales.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;<br />7. MOMENTUM SALES<br /><br /></h2>
<h3>OVERVIEW OF MOMENTUM SALES</h3>
<p>EDGE-X is circulated via a simplified pool structure (Momentum Sales with bonus incentives) where the purchasers / users can purchase EDGE-X through multiple crypto and fiat options.</p>
<p>EDGE196&trade; intends to run daily Momentum Sales year-round and plans to sell a total of 7.9 billion EDGE-X digital assets in incremental volumes. Each Momentum Sale will have a pre-defined number of EDGE-X that will be available through sale pools that will run till the pre-defined volumes are exhausted, or the maximum time limit is reached.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of sales, bonuses are allocated to the participating users (refer to bonus section)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>MOMENTUM SALE PARTICIPATION</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Momentum Sales run on:</p>
<ul>
<li>EDGE196<sup>&trade; </sup><a href="https://edge196.com/">website</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Exchanges - as primary offering.</li>
<li>By investment bankers, broker-dealers, funds around the world.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to participate in the&nbsp;Momentum Sale,&nbsp;users register on&nbsp;the&nbsp;edge196.com portal and go through mandatory KYC/AML.&nbsp;The Momentum Sale is&nbsp;also&nbsp;integrated into&nbsp;crypto exchanges as primary offerings.&nbsp;Exchanges will have pre-allocated&nbsp;EDGE-X volumes, thereby allowing registered users&nbsp;(from the exchange side)&nbsp;to&nbsp;participate seamlessly in Momentum Sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><br />MOMENTUM SALES VOLUMES</h3>
<p>Momentum Sale volumes are set based on the level of buying on the previous day&rsquo;s Momentum Sale as per the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the previous days Momentum Sale is 100% sold out, <br /> the next days&rsquo; EDGE-X volume is increased up <br /> to 10% of the previous days&rsquo; volume</li>
<li>If the previous days Momentum Sale is not sold out, the <br /> next days&rsquo; EDGE-X volume will be the same as <br /> the previous day.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDGE196<sup>&trade; </sup>will adjust the volume based on historic Momentum Sale data to ensure nominal demand is maintained. The first Momentum Sale&rsquo;s volume is set to 5,000 EDGE-X.</p>
<h3><br />PRICING MECHANISM</h3>
<p>On the first day of the Momentum Sale, the EDGE-X price will be set to $0.10 per EDGE-X.</p>
<p>Until the secondary market is established, the EDGE-X price will be determined by EDGE196&trade; with nominal set increases.</p>
<p>Once the secondary market is established, the EDGE-X price will be based on the secondary market value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A price oracle Is integrated into the platform to continuously feed in average secondary market pricing from the exchanges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>SETTLEMENT &amp; DISTRIBUTION PROCESS</h3>
<p>&nbsp;At the end of each Momentum Sale there is a small window of time that will be utilized for settlement. The settlement process entails distributing of the EDGE-X in the investor&rsquo;s digital wallets, as per the allocation.</p>
<h3><br />MAXIMUM TIME WINDOW</h3>
<p>Upon reaching the sale cut-off, the Momentum Sale is stopped, and the corresponding settlement will be initiated.</p>
<p>The settlement window will start after the completion of the Momentum Sale and will be used to allocate EDGE-X to investors and determine the volume for the next Momentum Sale.</p>
<p>Under exceptional circumstances, the EDGE196&trade; administrator will be able to suspend the Momentum Sale for a small period of time.</p>
<p>After the expiry of this period, the ongoing Momentum Sale will resume automatically.</p>
<h2><br />8. UNIVERSAL SWAP</h2>
<p>EDGE196<sup>&trade; </sup>has implemented a Universal Swap system which provides investors with a decentralized digital asset-swap option for EDGE-X and other digital assets.</p>
<p>Universal Swap enables an Investor to make immediate swaps between a number of supported digital assets.</p>
<p>These trades are only for whitelisted wallet holders that have been approved by EDGE196&trade; for KYC and AML regulatory requirements and subject to other regulations on a country-by-country basis. Should a receiving wallet not be on the whitelist, the transaction will fail to complete.</p>
<h2><br />9. POWER STAKING<br /><br /></h2>
<h3>POWER STAKING OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>EDGE-X holders can choose to take advantage of the Power Staking feature, which allows any amount of their EDGE-X to be staked, and in return benefit from staking rewards, which generate an ROI in the form of more EDGE-X digital assets.&nbsp; This is akin to a savings account that realizes interest.<br /><br /></p>
<h3>POWER STAKING GUIDELINES</h3>
<p>EDGE-X holders can choose to stake any amount of their EDGE-X using our Power Staking feature, and in return benefit from staking rewards, which generate an ROI in the form of more EDGE-X digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. MARKETPLACE</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>GLOBAL MARKETPLACE</h3>
<p>The EDGE196&trade; global marketplace will strive to connect startups and pre-vetted, qualified service providers.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide startups with a direct channel of communication with the EDGE196&trade; team, along with other services crucial for their growth in a global marketplace. <br /> <br /> Our marketplace will fully engage startups, investors, and qualified service providers. It will be a one-stop solution that seeks to provide an answer to all their needs.</p>
<p>Startups will enjoy special discounted service rates that are specific to participants in our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Investors and Service Providers who are part of our ecosystem can also use the marketplace and enjoy the same access and special discounted rates as the startups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>11. WHITELIST</h2>
<p>A whitelist is implemented to allow EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup>&rsquo;s smart contracts to interact only with approved addresses. This means only whitelisted addresses can receive and/or transact using EDGE-X once they have undergone suitable KYC/AML checks:</p>
<ul>
<li>EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> maintains one whitelist for each EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> digital asset and a whitelist processor updates the whitelist.</li>
<li>The EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> admin can block wallets that no longer meet AML/KYC or other terms of use from receiving new digital assets.</li>
<li>If investors purchase EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup>&rsquo;s digital assets from third-party exchanges, the investors' wallet address is automatically added to the whitelist once approved by the third-party exchange.</li>
<li>Investors from regulated countries will need to pass a full accreditation check.</li>
<li>During EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup>&rsquo;s Momentum sale, every investor is whitelisted based on their KYC/AML which is checked through third-party providers and updated within the EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> system.</li>
<li>The EDGE196<sup>&trade;</sup> system will periodically check the whitelist with KYC/AML providers against the existing investors and update accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3-TIERED INVESTMENT REVIEW PROCESS</h3>
<p><em>The EDGE</em><em>196&trade; </em>investment review process qualifies startups and determines the level of investment.</p>
<p>This decentralized process consists of three tiers of review which combines in depth technical and fundamentals reviews by highly experienced industry professionals, backed up with AI and Machine Learning algorithms, and finally the wisdom of the investors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>TIER 1<br /> Nomination by <em>EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em> partners and other stakeholders who propose companies which are sufficiently mature, financially viable and have passed basic product performance tests.<br /><br /></li>
<li>TIER 2<em><br />EDGE</em><em>196&trade;</em>&rsquo;s global team of industry experts perform a detailed evaluation, producing a recommendation based on the startups idea, business model, team and due-diligence.<br /><br /></li>
<li>TIER 3<br />EDGE-Q holders vote on proposals to fund prospective startups. They may also vote to extend funding to an existing portfolio company which has achieved certain milestones.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<h3>THE VETTING PROCESS</h3>
<p>The investment process is fully decentralized, controlled by the community of EDGE-Q token holders. Reasonably high-bar standard startups are first identified by community partners and stakeholders, then an internal team of experts issues a recommendation, and finally the EDGE-Q token holders vote on which startups merit funding, and which do not. Voting is proportional to the size of the amount of EDGE-Q each investor holds. <br /> </p>
<p>If rejected, some will be offered a program of training and mentoring, and then undergo a vote by EDGE-Q. If they receive 70% or more approval in this vote, they re-enter at the last tier they reached. <br /> <br /> If they do not receive 70% approval, they are rejected as a potential portfolio company, but still receive limited access to the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Once a startup company has successfully completed all 3 tiers, and received a successful vote of approval by investors, they receive access to funding subject to approval of their business plan and budge, full access to the marketplace, as well as world-class growth mentoring. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>STARTUP COMPETITIONS AND HACKATHONS</h3>
<p>Startup competitions, pitch-events and hackathons are one of the ways we identify startups with serious growth potential.</p>

<p>Our first startup competition launched in April 2017, focused on the India region, and 1100+ startups applied, with 7 reaching the grand final.</p>
<p>Our second startup competition launched in September 2017 and focused on the Fintech sector. Startups from more than 70 countries applied, of which 14 reached the grand final.</p>
<p>Ongoing initiatives and hackathons are now a major part of our strategy to discover and assess promising startups for investment, and our &lsquo;3-Ms&rsquo; process is a major part of how we enable these promising startups to succeed.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Risks Related to an Investment in Our Digital Assets</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /> <br /> </strong></p>
<ol start="11">
<li>There can be no assurance that our digital assets will ever be issued and, if the Company fails to issue digital assets, investors have no right to a refund of any portion of their investment.</li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>While we intend to develop EDGE-X digital assets to be issued to holders of our SAFE contracts, there can be no assurance that it will do so. SAFE holders will have no legal or equitable rights, interests or claims to any specific property or assets of the Company. The remaining SAFE would not be expected to possess economic value. Moreover, in the event of the Company&rsquo;s failure to issue the digital assets, investors have no right to receive a refund or any return of any portion of their investment.  As a result, investors should only invest in a SAFE if they are prepared to lose their entire investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="12">
<li><strong>If EDGE-Q digital assets are issued, the Company does not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Company issues EDGE-Q digital assets, the terms of such digital assets will be set forth in the certificate of designation, as summarized in the Terms and Conditions.  EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;may pay dividends in-kind, in U.S. Dollars, Bitcoin or Ether, in the Company&rsquo;s sole discretion, and will be paid only out of funds lawfully available for such payment when consolidated GAAP net income exceeds the dividend Amount, and only if declared by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.</p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;has no obligation to declare dividends. Currently, the Company does not expect to be in a position to pay dividends for some time into the future and can provide no assurances as to when dividends might first be paid, if ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="13">
<li><strong>At issuance, there will be no trading market for our digital assets, and a trading market may never develop.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the digital assets are issued, there will be no trading market immediately available for our digital assets, no alternative trading system or exchange and peer-to-peer transfers will not be permitted unless and until digital asset holders are notified otherwise by the Company and informed of the requirements to and conditions do so. As a result of recent regulatory developments, conventional crypto exchanges are currently unwilling to list securities tokens, such as the Company&rsquo;s EDGE-Q digital assets.  As a result, when the digital assets become transferable, they may only be traded on very limited range of venues, including U.S. registered exchanges or regulated alternative trading systems for which a Form ATS has been properly submitted to the SEC.  Currently, the Company is unaware of any operational ATS or exchange capable of supporting secondary trading in our EDGE-Q digital assets. Moreover, even if legally permitted, by purchasing digital assets, digital asset holders agree to additional transfer restrictions and shall not be able to effect transfers until such time as the Company informs holders that an alternative trading system or exchange is available or that peer-to-peer transfer processes have been established. As a result, holders of our digital assets should be prepared to hold their digital assets indefinitely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, even if the digital assets become transferable, we may rely on technology, including smart contracts, to implement certain restrictions on transferability in accordance with US federal securities laws.  There can be no assurance that such technology will function properly, which could result in technological limitations on transferability and expose the Company to legal and regulatory issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that our digital assets remain untradeable for a significant period of time or indefinitely, the value of the digital assets would be materially adversely affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong>Due to the unavailability of Rule</strong><strong> </strong><strong>144 for resales of digital assets by affiliates of the Company, Company affiliates may elect not to acquire the digital assets.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming that an alternative trading system or exchange never becomes available for trading of the digital assets, the Company does not expect Rule 144 ever to be available for any resales of digital assets by affiliates of the Company. As a result, affiliates of the Company may be unable to resell the digital assets unless the Company registers their sales. To make it easier for affiliates of the Company to publicly resell digital assets, the Company may in the future consider registering such resales;&nbsp;however, such registration statement may not become or remain effective and the Company has no obligation to register such digital assets. Furthermore, a seller under a registration statement may have liabilities that a seller under Rule 144 does not have. Any or all of these matters may cause affiliates of the Company to elect not to acquire the digital assets, which could depress the value of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="15">
<li><strong>The tax treatment of our digital assets is uncertain and there may be adverse tax consequences for purchasers upon certain future events.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The tax characterization of our digital assets is uncertain, and each purchaser must seek its own tax advice in connection with a purchase of our digital assets.  An investment in our digital assets may result in adverse tax consequences to purchasers, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.  See &ldquo;Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,&rdquo; herein. Each purchaser should consult with and must rely upon the advice of its own professional tax advisors with respect to the United States and non-U.S. tax treatment of an investment in our digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The tax characterization of our digital assets also affects the Company&rsquo;s tax liability in connection with the Offering.  In addition, the accounting consequences are uncertain, and there is a possibility that the proceeds of the Offering might be treated as a liability rather than equity for accounting purposes, which would reduce EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s net book value compared to equity treatment, which would prevent EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> from making dividend payments until such time, if ever, that EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s net book value increases to a positive amount at least greater than the aggregate amount of any proposed dividend.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="16">
<li><strong>The potential application of U.S. laws regarding investment into our digital assets is unclear.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our digital assets are novel and the application of U.S. federal and state securities laws is unclear in many respects. Because of the differences between our digital assets and traditional investment securities, there is a risk that issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if traditional securities were involved may not be easily resolved for our digital assets. In addition, because of the novel risks posed by our digital assets, it is possible that securities regulators may interpret laws in a manner that adversely affects the value of our digital assets.  For example, if applicable securities laws restrict the ability for the digital assets to be transferred, this would have a material adverse effect on the value of our digital assets. The occurrence of any such legal or regulatory issues or disputes, or uncertainty about the legal and regulatory framework applicable to our digital assets, could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Our digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="17">
<li><strong>If the digital assets ever become transferable, digital asset transactions may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that&nbsp;the our&nbsp;digital assets become tradeable on an alternative trading system or exchange or pursuant to permitted peer-to-peer transfers, transactions in the digital assets may be irreversible, and, accordingly, a purchaser of the digital assets may lose all of his or her investment in a variety of circumstances, including in connection with fraudulent or accidental transactions, technology failures or cyber-security breaches.  If applicable, real-time settlement would further increase the risk that correction of trading errors may be impossible and losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="18">
<li><strong>The nature of digital assets means that any technological difficulties experienced by an alternative trading system or exchange may prevent the access or use of our digital assets.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any alternative trading system or&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;will&nbsp;be subject to the risk of technological difficulties that may impact trading of the digital assets, which include, without limitation, failures of any blockchain on which the digital assets or the alternative trading system or exchange relies or the failure of smart contracts to function properly.  Trading in the digital assets will depend on the operation and functionality of the applicable alternative trading system or exchange and if such system were to fail for any reason, trading in the digital assets could be impossible until such failure was corrected and full functionality were restored and tested.  Any such technological difficulties may prevent the access or use of our digital assets.  This could have a material impact on the applicable alternative trading system or exchange&rsquo;s ability to execute or settle trades of the digital assets, to maintain accurate records of the ownership of the digital assets and to comply with obligations relating to records of the ownership of the digital assets and could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="19">
<li><strong>There is no assurance that purchasers of our digital assets will receive a return on their investment.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Our digital assets are highly speculative and any return on an investment in our digital assets is contingent upon numerous circumstances, many of which (including legal and regulatory conditions) are beyond the Company&rsquo;s control.  There is no assurance that purchasers will realize any return on their investments or that their entire investments will not be lost. For this reason, each purchaser should carefully read this Memorandum and should consult with their own attorney, financial and tax advisors prior to making any investment decision with respect to our digital assets.  Investors should only make an investment in our digital assets if they are prepared to lose the entirety of such investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="20">
<li><strong>The Company&rsquo;s management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this Offering.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>At present, the net proceeds of the Offering are expected to be used for (i) portfolio investments; (ii) the future development of the digital assets, (iv) the development and functionality of the&nbsp;EDGE ecosystem, (iii) general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt repayments, cybersecurity upgrades, augmenting technology, infrastructure and personnel, development of products and services, and short term investments, among other things, (iv) lobbying law makers and regulatory authorities for the purpose of bringing about changes to laws and regulations related to blockchain technologies, particularly in regards to digital assets, and (vii) offering, legal and accounting expenses. The failure by the Company&rsquo;s management to apply these funds effectively could have a material adverse effect on the Company and the value of our digital assets. Since the commencement of the Offering through the date of this Memorandum, the Company has utilized approximately $0 million, excluding amounts that may become due in connection with the purchase of portfolio investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="21">
<li><strong>Our digital assets may be subject to registration under the Exchange Act if the Company has assets above $10 million and more than 2,000 holders, which would increase the Company&rsquo;s costs and require substantial attention from management.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Companies with total assets above $10 million and more than 2,000 holders of record of its equity securities, or 500 holders of record of its equity securities who are not accredited investors, at the end of their fiscal year must register that class of equity securities with the SEC under the Exchange Act.  The Company could trigger this requirement as a result of the Offering and be required to register the digital assets with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which would be a laborious and expensive process.  Furthermore, if such registration takes place, the Company will have materially higher compliance and reporting costs going forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="22">
<li><strong>Purchasers may lack information for monitoring their investment.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our digital assets do not have any information rights attached to them (other than certain rights to Company information afforded digital asset holders under Delaware law), and purchasers may not be able to obtain all the information they would want regarding the Company or our digital assets. In particular, investors may not be able to receive information regarding the financial performance of the Company with respect to the ability of the Company to pay dividends. The Company is not currently registered with the SEC and currently has no periodic reporting requirements. As a result of these matters, as well as other uncertainties, a purchaser may not have accurate or accessible information about the Company or our digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="23">
<li><strong>Our digital assets have no history.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our digital assets will be newly formed and have no operating history and are entirely novel in type. Investors will not be able to compare them against other like instruments.  An investment in our digital assets should be evaluated on the basis of the value and prospects of the digital assets, taking into account uncertainties as to the likelihood that the digital assets will be issued, and of the assessment of the prospects of the Company&rsquo;s business may not prove accurate, and the Company may not achieve its objectives.  Past performance of the Company, or any similar token or SAFE issued by other companies, is not predictive of the Company&rsquo;s future results, the value and success of the Company&rsquo;s digital assets or the ability of the Company to ever pay dividends.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="24">
<li><strong>The Company does not expect there to be any market makers to develop a trading market in the digital assets.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most securities that are publicly traded in the United States have one or more broker-dealers acting as &ldquo;market makers&rdquo; for the security. A market maker is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell the security on a regular and continuous basis at publicly quoted prices. In the event that an alternative trading system or exchange is created or developed, the Company does not believe that our digital assets will have any market makers, which could contribute to a lack of liquidity in our digital assets, and could have a material adverse effect on holders&rsquo; ability to trade our digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="25">
<li><strong>Only certain persons and entities are able to acquire our digital assets.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Only limited categories of persons and entities may purchase our digital assets. The Company expects that these limitations will limit liquidity in our digital assets, and the limitations may have a material adverse effect on the development of any trading market in our digital assets. Our digital assets have not been registered under the Securities Act or any United States state securities laws or under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws. In addition, in offshore transactions our digital assets may be purchased only by non-U.S. Persons in accordance with applicable restrictions under the securities laws of the jurisdictions in which they are sold.  Generally, foreign securities laws restrict the categories of persons permitted to purchase securities, such as the digital assets, to specified classes of sophisticated investors.  No action has been taken in any jurisdiction to permit a public offering of our digital assets.  Moreover, in addition to legal restrictions, by acquiring digital assets, holders agree to additional transfer restrictions described in this Memorandum.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, it is expected that there will only be a limited number of digital asset holders, a purchaser of our digital assets and an owner of beneficial interests in those digital assets must be able to bear the economic risk of their investment in our digital assets indefinitely.  For a discussion of certain restrictions on resale and transfer, see &ldquo;Plan of Distribution&rdquo; and &ldquo;Notice to Purchasers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="26">
<li><strong>Our digital assets are not legal tender, are not backed by any government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation (&ldquo;SIPC&rdquo;) protections.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our digital assets are not legal tender, are not backed by any government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.  Any investment in our digital assets is made at the risk of the purchaser.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="27">
<li><strong>Our EDGE-Q digital assets are equity securities and are subordinate to existing and future indebtedness of the Company.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our EDGE-Q digital assets are equity interests in the Company. This means that EDGE-Q will rank junior to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company and to other non-equity claims on the Company with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on the Company, including claims in liquidation.  Additionally, unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest customarily are payable on specified due dates, in the case of EDGE-Q, (1) dividends are payable only when, as, and if declared by the Company, (2) dividends will not accumulate if they are not declared, and (3) because the Company is a Delaware corporation, the Company will be subject to restrictions on dividend payments and redemption payments out of lawfully available funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, the digital assets place no restrictions on the business or operations of the Company or on its ability to incur additional indebtedness or engage in any transactions, subject only to the limited voting rights required under Delaware law.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, if payment of a dividend on the digital assets for any period would cause the Company to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, the Company will not pay a dividend for such period and no dividend will accrue, accumulate or be payable for that dividend period.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company&rsquo;s ability to pay dividends depends upon the results of operations of its subsidiaries.  There are regulatory restrictions upon certain of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries&rsquo; ability to make dividend or other payments to the Company.  As a result, there can be no assurance that the Company will have sufficient funds available for the declaration of any dividend with respect to any dividend period.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="28">
<li><strong>The digital assets may have lower priority to certain rights and preferences than future tokens or equity of the Company.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The digital assets may have lower priority to certain rights and preferences than other tokens and/or equity that the Company issues in the future, which by its terms is expressly higher priority than the digital assets. The terms of any future tokens and/or equity that are higher priority than the digital assets may restrict dividend payments on the digital assets. In this case, unless full dividends for all such outstanding tokens and equity with higher priority than the digital assets have been declared and paid or set aside for payment, no dividends will be declared or paid and no distribution will be made on any digital assets, and no digital assets will be permitted to be repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Company, directly or indirectly, for consideration. This could result in dividends on the digital assets not being paid to you or digital assets not being redeemed.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="29">
<li><strong>Some market participants may oppose the development of distributed ledger or blockchain-based systems like those central to the Company&rsquo;s commercial mission.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many participants in the system currently used for trading securities in the United States may oppose the development of capital markets systems and processes that utilize distributed ledger and blockchain-based systems. The market participants who may oppose such a system may include market participants with significantly greater resources, including financial resources and political influence, than the Company has. The ability of the Company to operate and achieve its commercial goals could be adversely affected by any actions of any such market participants that result in additional regulatory requirements or other activities that make it more difficult for the Company to operate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Risks Related to Blockchain Technology</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="30">
<li><strong>The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and offerings of digital assets, such as the digital assets, is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development and the value of the digital assets.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Regulation of digital assets, like EDGE-Q and EDGE-X, and offerings such as this, cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges, is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them, varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty.  Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of the digital assets, tokens generally and, in each case, the technology behind them or the means of transaction in or transferring them.  Failure by the Company or certain users of our digital assets to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or that are subject to interpretations that may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency networks, distributed ledger technologies, and coin and token offerings also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, China and Russia.  Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the digital assets.  Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States or may directly and negatively impact the Company&rsquo;s business.  The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to the adoption and value of the digital assets and the financial performance of the Company.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, in the United States and other jurisdictions, may materially and adversely impact the value of the digital assets, including with respect to the dividends that may be made, the liquidity of the digital assets, the ability to access marketplaces or exchanges on which to trade the digital assets, and the structure, rights and transferability of digital assets.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="31">
<li><strong>The further development and acceptance of blockchain networks, which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.</strong><strong> </strong><strong> The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of blockchain networks and blockchain assets would have an adverse material effect on the successful development and adoption of the digital assets.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The growth of the blockchain industry in general, as well as the blockchain networks on which the digital assets will rely, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.  The factors affecting the further development of the cryptocurrency and cryptosecurity industry, as well as blockchain networks, include, without limitation:&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>                  worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies,&nbsp;cryptosecurities&nbsp;and other blockchain technologies;</li>
<li>                  government and quasi-government regulation of cryptocurrencies,&nbsp;cryptosecurities&nbsp;and other blockchain assets and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of blockchain networks or similar systems;</li>
<li>                  the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of cryptocurrency or&nbsp;cryptosecurities&nbsp;networks;</li>
<li>                  changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;</li>
<li>                  the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;</li>
<li>                  general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;cryptosecurities; and</li>
<li>                  a decline in the popularity or acceptance of cryptocurrencies or other blockchain-based tokens would adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s results of operations.</li>
</ul>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency and&nbsp;cryptosecurities&nbsp;industries as a whole have been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly evolving.  Although they have experienced significant growth in recent years, the slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of blockchain networks and blockchain assets may deter or delay the acceptance and adoption of the digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>
<ol start="32">
<li><strong>The prices of digital assets are extremely volatile.</strong><strong> </strong><strong> Fluctuations in the price of digital assets could materially and adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s business, and the digital assets may also be subject to significant price volatility.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The prices of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ether, and other digital assets have historically been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile, and the market price of the digital assets may also be highly volatile.  Several factors may influence the market price, if any, of the digital assets, including, but not limited to:&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>                  the ability of the digital assets to trade in a secondary market, if at all;</li>
<li>                  the availability of an alternative trading system or exchange or other trading platform for digital assets;</li>
<li>                  global digital asset and security token supply;</li>
<li>                  global digital asset and security token demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants&rsquo; and commercial businesses&rsquo; acceptance of digital assets like cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the security of online digital asset exchanges and digital wallets that hold digital assets, the perception that the use and holding of digital assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions on their use;</li>
<li>                  purchasers&rsquo; expectations with respect to the rate of inflation;</li>
<li>                  changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying the digital assets;</li>
<li>                  changes in the rights, obligations, incentives, or rewards for the various holders of the digital assets;</li>
<li>                  interest rates;</li>
<li>                  currency exchange rates, including the rates at which digital assets may be exchanged for fiat currencies;</li>
<li>                  government-backed currency withdrawal and deposit policies of digital asset exchanges;</li>
<li>                  interruptions in service from or failures of major digital asset and security token exchange on which digital assets and security tokens are traded;</li>
<li>                  investment and trading activities of large purchasers, including private and registered funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in securities tokens or other digital assets;</li>
<li>                  monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations;</li>
<li>                  regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of digital assets and security tokens such as the digital assets;</li>
<li>                  global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; and</li>
<li>                  expectations among digital assets participants that the value of security tokens or other digital assets will soon change.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A decrease in the price of a single digital asset may cause volatility in the entire digital asset and security token industry and may affect other digital assets including the digital assets.  For example, a security breach that affects purchaser or user confidence in Bitcoin or Ether may affect the industry as a whole and may also cause the price of the digital assets and other digital assets to fluctuate.  Such volatility in the price of the digital assets may result in significant loss over a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The terms of the digital assets may also lead to additional price volatility.  &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><br /> </strong><strong>Risks Related to the Company&rsquo;s Business</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><br /> <br /> </strong></p>
<ol start="33">
<li><strong>The Company has, to date, relied upon funding from its founder and if such funding were not provided, it would have an adverse impact on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company is currently wholly-owned by its founder.  The Company does not have any legally binding commitment from any person, including its founder, to contribute additional capital or to make any loan to it.  If its founder were to be unable or unwilling to fund the Company&rsquo;s operations in the future, or if its founder were to become the subject of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions would be materially adversely impacted.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="34">
<li><strong>There is no assurance that the Company will be able to continue as a going concern.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company has generated limited revenue and has accumulated losses since inception. As such, the Company&rsquo;s continuation as a going concern is currently dependent upon the continued financial support from its founder, which it has provided but is under no obligation to continue to do so. Although the Company anticipates the proceeds from the Offering will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its operating commitments for the next twelve months, there is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving this objective. Since the commencement of the Offering through the date of this Memorandum, the Company has utilized approximately $0 million, excluding amounts that may become due in connection with the transaction contemplated herein or toward the purchase of portfolio investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;<br /> <br /> </p>
<ol start="35">
<li><strong>Certain of our officers and directors participate in other business ventures and, as a result, may have limited time to devote to our business or may compete with the Company.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain of our officers and directors participate in other business ventures.  As a result of such participation, management anticipates devoting a portion of their time per month to such other business ventures. Moreover, such outside business ventures may at times compete directly with the Company or result in conflicts of interest in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="36">
<li><strong>The Company&rsquo;s business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, technology, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to the Company&rsquo;s business practices, increased cost of operations or otherwise harm the Company&rsquo;s business.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to its business, including user privacy, blockchain technology, broker dealer, data protection and intellectual property, among others. Foreign data protection, privacy, broker dealer and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which the Company operates.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company has adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws. The growth of its business and its expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or its internal policies and procedures. The risk of the Company&rsquo;s being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against the Company for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if the Company successfully defends against it, could cause the Company to incur significant legal expenses and divert its management&rsquo;s attention from the operation of its business. If the Company&rsquo;s operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, the Company may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, the Company could be required to refund payments received by it, and it could be required to curtail or cease its operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm its business and its financial results. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase its operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject the Company to claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that the Company modifies or ceases existing business practices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="37">
<li><strong>The Company is subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Investment Company Act regulates certain companies that invest in, hold or trade securities. As a result of a portion of the Company&rsquo;s assets consisting of minority investment positions, it runs the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require the Company to register under the Investment Company Act. Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, leverage, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which the Company operates its business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that the Company has with its affiliated companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid becoming and registering as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, the Company intends to monitor the value of its investments and structure transactions accordingly. As a result, the Company may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if it was not subject to such Investment Company Act risks, or the Company may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to this risk. In addition, events beyond the Company&rsquo;s control, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of its publicly traded holdings or adverse developments with respect to its ownership of certain of its subsidiaries, could result in the Company inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that the Company were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that it could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that the Company would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with the Company undertaken during the period it was established that the Company was an unregistered investment company. If it were established that the Company were an investment company, this would have a material adverse effect on its business and financial operations and its ability to continue as a going concern.&nbsp;</p>

<li><strong>The popularity of cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;cryptosecurities&nbsp;offerings may decrease in the future, which could have a material impact on the cryptocurrency and&nbsp;cryptosecurities&nbsp;industry and the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company was founded to develop and commercialize financial technology based on the use of digital assets, digital securities (or&nbsp;cryptosecurities) and blockchain technology. In recent years, cryptocurrencies and&nbsp;cryptosecurities&nbsp;have become more widely accepted among investors and financial institutions, but have been also faced increasingly complex legal and regulatory challenges and, to date, have not benefited from widespread adoption by governments, central banks or established financial institutions. Any significant decrease in the acceptance or popularity of cryptocurrency or cryptosecurity offerings may have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="39">
<li><strong>Dividends made pursuant to the terms of the digital assets may detract from the capital the Company could otherwise deploy to improve its business.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><br /> Following the issuance of the digital assets, if declared by the Company out of funds lawfully available therefor, holders of the EDGE-Q digital assets will receive dividends. Any capital used to pay dividends detracts from the capital available for the Company to deploy in developing its business.  Diverting the funds from the Company&rsquo;s operations may put the Company at a significant disadvantage in comparison to its competitors who do not make similar dividend payments.  This disadvantage may have an adverse impact on the operations and financial conditions of the Company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>  &nbsp;</p>
<ol start="40">
<li><strong>The Company owes significant amounts to its founder and has limited cash flow to fund both its ongoing operating costs and debt service.</strong><strong> </strong><strong> The Company may need additional financing to fund its continuing operations.</strong></li>

<li><strong>The value ascribed to the digital assets by the holders may depend, in part, on the number and scope of Discretionary Benefits that the Company may provide to digital asset holders in the future.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company expects to endeavor to create certain Discretionary Benefits for holders of the digital assets in the future.  The terms and conditions of our digital assets do not entitle holders to any Discretionary Benefits, and potential purchasers should not ascribe any value to such Discretionary Benefits in making their investment decision.  If in the future, certain Discretionary Benefits are provided to holders of the digital assets, it is possible that token holders will ascribe some value to these Discretionary Benefits.  However, any such Discretionary Benefits may be terminated and cease at any time and, to the extent that holders are attributing value to such Discretionary Benefits, any such termination or cessation may cause the value of the digital assets to decrease and such decrease may be material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company and certain of its advisors are subject to applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private information could subject the Company or any of them to fines, penalties or other regulatory actions, as well as to civil actions by affected parties. Any such violations could adversely affect the ability of the Company to operate the digital asset Trading System, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Company and its blockchain technology to be utilized for its digital assets will be subject to cyberattacks, security risks and risks of security breaches. An attack on any of them or a breach of security of any of them could result in a loss of private data, unauthorized trades, and an interruption of trading for an extended period of time. Any such attack or breach could adversely affect the ability of the Company to effectively operate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions.</p>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> ecosystem, and any digital assets that may be developed in the future, including technology and intellectual property involved in their creation and operation, has been or will be, as applicable, developed primarily by a small number of key technology employees of the Company and its affiliates. The loss of the services of any of those key employees could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to develop, operate or maintain the EDGE ecosystem or the digital assets. If the Company were to lose the services of any such key employees, it could be difficult or impossible to replace them, and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company&rsquo;s operations and financial conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Company believes that a number of organizations are or may be working to develop venture capital investing structures with distributed ledger or blockchain technologies or other novel technologies that may be competitive with its own technology. Some or all of such organizations may have substantially greater technological expertise, experience with distributed ledger technologies and/or financial resources than the Company or its founder has, and many of them may be attempting to patent technologies competitive with or similar to the technology the Company utilizes. The Company does not have access to detailed information about the technologies these organizations and/or their respective purchasers may be attempting to patent. If one or more other persons, companies or organizations obtains a valid patent covering technology critical to EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> or any future needs, to operate its business as intended might be unable or unwilling to license the technology, and it could become impossible for EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> or its digital assets to operate, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The markets for technology products and services are highly competitive.&nbsp;We&nbsp;will seek to differentiate our portfolio companies&rsquo; products from other suppliers, and to sustain proﬁtability through a business&nbsp;strategy focused on developing new products and increasing sales, selectively expanding our products and services network, increasing sales through newly formed partnerships (traditional&nbsp;and non-traditional),&nbsp;developing&nbsp;innovative&nbsp;new&nbsp;products&nbsp;and&nbsp;services,&nbsp;and&nbsp;driving&nbsp;operational&nbsp;excellence&nbsp;by reducing costs and increasing customer service levels.&nbsp;We&nbsp;believe that competition in the industry is based on price, product and service quality, customer service and product features.&nbsp;Sustained&nbsp;increases in competitive pressures could have an adverse effect on results of operations and negatively impact sales and&nbsp;margins.&nbsp;</p>

If debt incurred with respect to one of our portfolio companies is cross-collateralized, a default with respect to one portfolio company may result in losses on other&nbsp;portfolio companies.

In the event EDGE196TM or its afﬁliates are subsequently required to register as investment advisers under the Advisers Act, Delaware Investment Advisers&nbsp;Acts&nbsp;or&nbsp;other&nbsp;comparable&nbsp;state&nbsp;laws,&nbsp;purchasers&nbsp;may&nbsp;be entitled to certain protections under those statutes, but the costs of &nbsp;compliance&nbsp;with&nbsp;those&nbsp;statutes&nbsp;and the&nbsp;operating&nbsp;restrictions&nbsp;and&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;imposed&nbsp;on&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;and&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;may&nbsp;adversely affect&nbsp;the&nbsp;operation&nbsp;and&nbsp;ﬁnancial&nbsp;performance&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;intends to operate so as to not be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, based upon certain exemptions thereunder. Speciﬁcally, EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> expects to be exempted from registration under the Investment Company Act under section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.&nbsp;Accordingly,&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;does not expect to be subject to the restrictive provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940; however, if EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;fails&nbsp;to&nbsp;qualify&nbsp;for&nbsp;exemption&nbsp;from&nbsp;registration&nbsp;as&nbsp;an investment&nbsp;company,&nbsp;its&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;conduct its business as described herein will be compromised. The business opportunities pursued by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;may be limited by the requirements of available exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940,&nbsp;and&nbsp;any&nbsp;such&nbsp;failure&nbsp;to&nbsp;qualify&nbsp;for&nbsp;such&nbsp;exemption&nbsp;would&nbsp;likely&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;material&nbsp;adverse&nbsp;effect&nbsp;on&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;<br /> </p>

Additional changes to the tax laws are likely to continue to occur, and we&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;assure you that any such changes will not adversely affect your taxation as a Class A digital asset holder.

<p>Uncertainty regarding the availability of research funding or reimbursements may adversely affect portfolio companies operating results and may adversely affect sales to customers or potential customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our portfolio companies&rsquo; operating results may ﬂuctuate substantially due to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures&nbsp;by&nbsp;these&nbsp;academic&nbsp;and&nbsp;governmental&nbsp;research&nbsp;institutions.&nbsp;Any decrease in such budgets or expenditures, or in the size, scope or frequency of capital or operating expenditures, could materially and adversely affect the proﬁtability&nbsp;of&nbsp;our&nbsp;portfolio companies,&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus, our business, operating results and ﬁnancial&nbsp;condition.&nbsp;</p>

</ol>
<p>Our digital assets are being offered on a &ldquo;best efforts&rdquo; basis and no individual, ﬁrm or corporation has agreed to purchase any digital assets in this offering.

<p>If&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;unable&nbsp;to&nbsp;sell&nbsp;a sufficient amount of equity digital assets,&nbsp;we&nbsp;will&nbsp;make&nbsp;fewer purchases, resulting in less diversiﬁcation in terms of the numbers and types of purchases we own and the areas in which our purchases or the properties underlying our purchases are located&nbsp;which would make it more difﬁcult for us to accomplish our business objectives. Further, it is likely that in our early stages of growth we may not be able to achieve portfolio diversiﬁcation consistent with our longer-term purchase objectives, increasing the likelihood that any single purchase&rsquo;s poor&nbsp;performance would materially affect our overall purchase performance. Our inability to raise substantial funds would also increase our ﬁxed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income. Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our ﬁnancial condition and ability to pay distributions to digital asset holders.&nbsp;<br /> </p>

In addition, during the process of exiting purchases, if portfolio companies are taken public, EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;is highly likely to be required to continue to hold minority equity stakes for a certain period of time after the public offering. In cases where EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> holds minority positions in its portfolio companies and will not have the ability to sell&nbsp;its&nbsp;portfolio companies without majority owner consent or to unilaterally cause portfolio companies to enter into transactions which would enable EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> to liquidate its holdings.

<p>This discussion only applies to individual citizens or residents of the United States who hold digital assets as capital assets within the meaning of Code Section 1221 (generally, property held for purchase). The tax treatment of unitholders may vary depending upon their particular situations. Certain&nbsp;holders,&nbsp;including&nbsp;corporations,&nbsp;estates,&nbsp;trusts,&nbsp;insurance&nbsp;companies,&nbsp;tax&nbsp;exempt&nbsp;organizations or governmental organizations, banks and other ﬁnancial institutions, pass-through entities and purchasers in pass-through entities, taxpayers subject to the alternative minimum tax, broker-dealers,&nbsp;traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings,&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;holders&nbsp;whose&nbsp;functional&nbsp;currency&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;the&nbsp;U.S. Dollar,&nbsp;regulated&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;companies, real&nbsp;estate&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;trusts&nbsp;and&nbsp;persons&nbsp;holding&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;as&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;&ldquo;straddle&rdquo;,&nbsp;&ldquo;hedge,&rdquo; &ldquo;constructive sale,&rdquo;&nbsp;&ldquo;conversion transaction,&rdquo; or other integrated transaction or risk reduction transaction, &ldquo;controlled foreign corporations,&rdquo; &ldquo;passive foreign purchase companies,&rdquo; and certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, may be subject to special rules not discussed below.

<p><strong>Partnership Status</strong><strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </strong></p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;organized&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;Delaware&nbsp;limited partnership,&nbsp;and&nbsp;intends&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;classiﬁed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A partnership is pass-through entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. Instead, each partner of a partnership&nbsp;is&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;take&nbsp;into&nbsp;account&nbsp;his&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;items&nbsp;of&nbsp;income,&nbsp;gain,&nbsp;loss&nbsp;and&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;of&nbsp;the partnership in computing his <br /> U.S. federal income tax liability, regardless of whether cash distributions are made to him by the partnership. &nbsp;Distributions&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner&nbsp;are&nbsp;generally&nbsp;not&nbsp;taxable to the partnership or the partner unless the amount of cash distributed to the&nbsp;partner&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;excess&nbsp;of&nbsp;the partner&rsquo;s adjusted basis in the partner&rsquo;s partnership&nbsp;interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Section&nbsp;7704&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Code&nbsp;provides&nbsp;that&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;classiﬁed&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;&ldquo;publicly&nbsp;traded&nbsp;partnership&rdquo; will, as a general rule, be treated as a corporation.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;an&nbsp;exception,&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;&ldquo;qualifying income exception,&rdquo; exists with respect to publicly traded partnerships of which 90%&nbsp;or&nbsp;more&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;gross income&nbsp;of&nbsp;every&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;year&nbsp;consists&nbsp;of&nbsp;&ldquo;qualifying&nbsp;income&rdquo;&nbsp;(generally,&nbsp;interest,&nbsp;dividends,&nbsp;real&nbsp;property rents, gain from the sale of real property, gain from the sale of capital assets and certain other items).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;expects&nbsp;to&nbsp;satisfy&nbsp;certain&nbsp;other&nbsp;safe&nbsp;harbors&nbsp;set&nbsp;forth&nbsp;in&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;Regulations, and therefore expects that it will not be considered a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;were&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;classiﬁed&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;&ldquo;association&rdquo;&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;corporation&nbsp;or&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;&ldquo;publicly&nbsp;traded&nbsp;partnership&rdquo; taxable as a corporation, EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at the tax rates applicable to corporations, and the members would not be allowed to claim any Fund tax credits or deduct any Fund operating losses on their individual returns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition,&nbsp;any&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;made&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&nbsp;would&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated&nbsp;as&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;dividend&nbsp;income,&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;extent of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s current and accumulated earnings and proﬁts, or, in the absence of earnings and&nbsp;proﬁts, a nontaxable return of capital, to the extent of the member&rsquo;s tax basis in his digital assets, or taxable&nbsp;capital gain, after the member&rsquo;s tax basis in his digital assets is reduced to zero.</p>
<p>Accordingly, taxation as a corporation would likely result in a reduction, which could be material, in a member&rsquo;s cash ﬂow and after-tax&nbsp;return&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;would&nbsp;likely&nbsp;result&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;reduction,&nbsp;which&nbsp;could&nbsp;be&nbsp;substantial,&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;Digital assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Flow-Through of Taxable Income</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject to the discussion below under &ldquo;Entity-Level Collections,&rdquo; EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> will not pay any U.S. federal income tax. Instead, each member will be&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;report&nbsp;on&nbsp;his&nbsp;income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;return&nbsp;his&nbsp;share&nbsp;of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s allocable income, gains, losses and deductions without regard to whether&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> makes&nbsp;cash&nbsp;distributions&nbsp;to&nbsp;him.&nbsp;Consequently,&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;may&nbsp;allocate&nbsp;income&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&nbsp;even&nbsp;if he has not received a cash&nbsp;distribution.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Allocation of Income, Gain, Loss, and Deduction</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the allocation provisions contained in the Limited Partnership Agreement will determine each member&rsquo;s share of the items of proﬁts and losses of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> to the extent that such allocations are made in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;IRS&nbsp;generally&nbsp;respects&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership&rsquo;s&nbsp;allocation&nbsp;of&nbsp;income,&nbsp;gain,&nbsp;loss,&nbsp;deductions&nbsp;or&nbsp;credits&nbsp;if:&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;the allocation has economic effect and is substantial, or (b) the partners can show that the allocation accords with each partner&rsquo;s respective interest in us, and (c) in the case of either (a)&nbsp;or&nbsp;(b),&nbsp;the&nbsp;allocation complies with special rules requiring that partners receiving allocations of losses or deductions generated by purchasing assets&nbsp;with&nbsp;borrowed&nbsp;money&nbsp;be&nbsp;charged&nbsp;back&nbsp;income&nbsp;and&nbsp;gain&nbsp;as&nbsp;those&nbsp;funds are&nbsp;repaid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2) generally provides that, for an allocation to have economic effect, the following conditions must be true:</p>
<p>(i) the allocation must be reﬂected by an increase or decrease in the relevant partner&rsquo;s capital account, as those accounts are maintained in&nbsp; accordance&nbsp;with the Treasury Regulations; (ii) liquidation proceeds must be distributed in accordance with the partner&rsquo;s positive capital account balances; and (iii) the partnership agreement must provide that if a partner will have a deficit balance in his or her capital account upon &nbsp;liquidation&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;partnership,&nbsp;the&nbsp;partner&nbsp;must be required to restore the deﬁcit amount to the partnership, so that amount may be distributed to other partners with positive capital account balances. However, the Treasury Regulations provide that in the absence of an obligation to restore the deﬁcit, the partnership agreement must contain a qualiﬁed income offset provision. A qualiﬁed income offset provision mandates that when a partner receives a distribution from the partnership that causes a deﬁcit in the partner&rsquo;s capital account or increases a preexisting deﬁcit, that partner must be allocated income and gains as quickly as possible to eliminate any deﬁcit balance in his or her capital account that is greater than any amount that he or she is obligated to&nbsp;restore.&nbsp;<br /> </p>
<p>The economic effect of an allocation is substantial if there is a reasonable possibility that it will substantially affect the amount to be received by the members from EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>, independent of tax consequences. In addition, an economic effect is not substantial if, at the time the allocation becomes part of the&nbsp;Limited Partnership&nbsp;Agreement: (1) at least one member&rsquo;s after-tax return&nbsp;may,&nbsp;in present value terms, be enhanced&nbsp;compared&nbsp;to&nbsp;his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her&nbsp;return&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;allocation&nbsp;were&nbsp;not&nbsp;contained&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Limited Partnership&nbsp;Agreement;&nbsp;and (2) there is a strong likelihood that no member&rsquo;s after-tax return will, in present value terms, be substantially diminished compared to his or her return if the allocation were not contained in the Limited Partnership Agreement. Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2) generally states that, in determining after-tax return, a member&rsquo;s entire tax situation, including aspects unrelated to EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>, will be taken into account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> believes that the allocation provisions of the&nbsp;Limited Partnership&nbsp;Agreement satisfy applicable Treasury Regulations, given the complexity of the Treasury Regulations in this area, there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with all of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s computations and allocations&nbsp;of&nbsp;proﬁts&nbsp;and losses. If upon audit the IRS were to take the position that any of EDGE196<sup> TM</sup>&rsquo;s allocations of proﬁts and losses should not be recognized, and if the IRS&rsquo;s position were sustained by the courts, a&nbsp;member could be taxed on a portion of the income allocated to another member, and part of the deductions allocated to such member could be&nbsp;disallowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tax Consequences of Distributions</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distributions made by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> to a member generally will not be taxable to the member for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the &nbsp;extent the&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;any&nbsp;such&nbsp;cash&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;exceeds&nbsp;such member&rsquo;s tax basis in its digital assets immediately before the distribution. Cash distributions made by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> to a member in an amount in excess of a member&rsquo;s tax basis generally will be considered&nbsp;to be gain from the sale or exchange of the digital assets, taxable in accordance with the rules described under&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;Tax&nbsp;Consequences of Disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Any reduction in a member&rsquo;s share of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s liabilities, including liabilities for which no member bears the economic risk of loss, will be treated&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;distribution by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> of cash to that member.&nbsp;To&nbsp;the extent EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s distributions cause a member&rsquo;s &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year, the member must recapture any losses&nbsp;deducted&nbsp;in&nbsp;previous&nbsp;years.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;read&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;Limitations&nbsp;on&nbsp;Deductibility&nbsp;of&nbsp;Losses&rdquo;&nbsp;above.&nbsp;<br /> </p>
<p>A decrease in a member&rsquo;s percentage interest in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> because of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s issuance&nbsp;of additional&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;will&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;its&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;nonrecourse&nbsp;liabilities,&nbsp;and&nbsp;thus&nbsp;will&nbsp;result&nbsp;in&nbsp;a corresponding deemed distribution of cash. This deemed distribution may constitute a non-pro rata distribution.&nbsp;A&nbsp;non-pro rata distribution of money or property may result in ordinary income to a&nbsp;member, regardless of its tax basis in its digital assets, if the distribution reduces the member&rsquo;s share of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s &ldquo;unrealized receivables,&rdquo; including depreciation recapture, depletion recapture&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;substantially appreciated &ldquo;inventory items,&rdquo; each as defined in the Code, and collectively,&nbsp;&ldquo;Section&nbsp;751&nbsp;Assets.&rdquo;&nbsp;To&nbsp;that extent,&nbsp;the&nbsp;member&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated&nbsp;as&nbsp;having&nbsp;been&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;its&nbsp;proportionate&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Section&nbsp;751 Assets&nbsp;and&nbsp;then&nbsp;having&nbsp;exchanged&nbsp;those&nbsp;assets&nbsp;with&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;in&nbsp;return&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;non-pro&nbsp;rata&nbsp;portion of the actual distribution made to such member.&nbsp;This&nbsp;latter&nbsp;deemed&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;will&nbsp;generally&nbsp;result&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;member&rsquo;s realization of ordinary income, which will equal the excess of (i) the non-pro rata portion of that distribution over (ii) the member&rsquo;s tax basis (generally zero) for the share of Section 751 Assets deemed relinquished in the&nbsp;exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Basis of the digital assets</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A member&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis for his or her digital assets, initially the amount of money he contributes to EDGE196<sup>TM&nbsp;</sup>to&nbsp;acquire&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;offered&nbsp;hereunder,&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;increased&nbsp;by&nbsp;his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her&nbsp;allocable&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;taxable income of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A member&rsquo;s basis in his or her digital assets will be decreased, but not below zero, by (i) distributions to the member by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>; (ii)&nbsp;his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her&nbsp;allocable&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;tax&nbsp;losses&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>;&nbsp;and&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;his&nbsp;or her allocable share of Fund expenditures that are not currently deductible or capitalizable. If the basis&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&rsquo;s&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;is&nbsp;reduced&nbsp;to&nbsp;zero,&nbsp;the&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;any&nbsp;distributions&nbsp;in&nbsp;excess&nbsp;of&nbsp;his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her&nbsp;share of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;income&nbsp;for&nbsp;any&nbsp;year&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated&nbsp;as&nbsp;capital&nbsp;gain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on Deductibility of Losses</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deduction by a member of his share of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s losses will be limited to the tax basis in his digital assets and, in the case of an individual Member,&nbsp;estate,&nbsp;trust,&nbsp;or&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;Member&nbsp;(if&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;50% of the value of the corporate Member&rsquo;s stock is owned directly or indirectly by or for ﬁve or fewer individuals or some tax-exempt organizations), to the amount for which the Member is considered to be &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; with respect to &nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;activities,&nbsp;if&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;less&nbsp;than&nbsp;his&nbsp;tax&nbsp;basis.&nbsp;A&nbsp;Member&nbsp;subject to these limitations must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that distributions&nbsp;cause his at-risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year. Losses disallowed to a&nbsp;Member or recaptured as a result of these limitations will carry forward and will be allowable as a deduction to the extent that his at-risk amount is subsequently increased, provided such losses do not exceed such unitholders&rsquo; tax basis in his digital assets. Upon the taxable disposition of a Class A DIGITAL ASSET, any gain recognized by a Member can be offset by losses that were previously suspended by the at-risk limitation but may not be offset by losses suspended by the basis limitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any loss previously suspended&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;at-risk&nbsp;limitation&nbsp;in&nbsp;excess&nbsp;of&nbsp;that&nbsp;gain&nbsp;would&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer&nbsp;be&nbsp;utilizable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, a member will be at risk to the extent of the tax basis of his digital assets, excluding any portion of that&nbsp;basis&nbsp;attributable&nbsp;to&nbsp;his&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;nonrecourse&nbsp;liabilities,&nbsp;reduced&nbsp;by&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;any&nbsp;portion&nbsp;of that basis representing amounts otherwise protected against loss because of a guarantee, stop loss agreement or other similar arrangement and (ii) any amount of money he borrows to acquire&nbsp;or&nbsp;hold&nbsp;his digital assets, if the lender of those borrowed funds owns an interest in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>, is related to the member or&nbsp;can&nbsp;look&nbsp;only&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;for&nbsp;repayment.&nbsp;A&nbsp;member&rsquo;s&nbsp;at-risk&nbsp;amount&nbsp;will&nbsp;increase&nbsp;or&nbsp;decrease&nbsp;as&nbsp;the tax basis of the member&rsquo;s digital assets increases or decreases, other than tax basis increases or decreases attributable to increases or decreases in his share of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s &nbsp;nonrecourse&nbsp;liabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the basis and at-risk limitations on the deductibility of losses, the passive loss limitations generally provide that individuals, estates, trusts and some closely-held corporations and personal service corporations can deduct losses from passive activities, which are generally trade or business activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, only to the extent of the taxpayer&rsquo;s income from those passive activities. Subject to certain limitations and conditions, passive losses EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> generates may be available to offset EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s passive income generated in the future&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;income&nbsp;from&nbsp;other&nbsp;passive&nbsp;activities.&nbsp;Passive&nbsp;losses&nbsp;that&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;deductible&nbsp;because&nbsp;they&nbsp;exceed a member&rsquo;s share of income EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> generated may be deducted in full when he disposes of his entire purchase in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> in a fully taxable transaction with an unrelated party. <br /> </p>
<p>The&nbsp;passive&nbsp;loss limitations&nbsp;are&nbsp;applied&nbsp;after&nbsp;other&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;limitations&nbsp;on&nbsp;deductions,&nbsp;including&nbsp;the&nbsp;at-risk&nbsp;rules&nbsp;and&nbsp;the basis limitation. Subject to certain limitations and conditions, a member&rsquo;s share of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s net income may be offset by any of EDGE196TM&rsquo;s suspended passive losses and may be offset by any other&nbsp;current&nbsp;or&nbsp;carryover&nbsp;losses&nbsp;from&nbsp;other&nbsp;passive&nbsp;activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An additional loss limitation may apply to certain of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s members for taxable&nbsp;years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026.</p>
<p>A non-corporate member will not be allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;take&nbsp;a&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;for&nbsp;certain&nbsp;excess&nbsp;business&nbsp;losses&nbsp;in&nbsp;such&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;years.&nbsp;An&nbsp;excess&nbsp;business loss&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;excess&nbsp;(if&nbsp;any)&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;taxpayer&rsquo;s&nbsp;aggregate&nbsp;deductions&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;year&nbsp;that&nbsp;are&nbsp;attributable to the trades or businesses of such taxpayer (determined without regard to the excess business loss limitation) over the aggregate gross income or gain of such taxpayer for the taxable year that is attributable&nbsp;to&nbsp;such&nbsp;trades&nbsp;or&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;plus&nbsp;a&nbsp;threshold&nbsp;amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;threshold&nbsp;amount&nbsp;is&nbsp;equal&nbsp;to $250,000,&nbsp;or&nbsp;$500,000&nbsp;for&nbsp;taxpayers&nbsp;ﬁling&nbsp;a&nbsp;joint&nbsp;return.&nbsp;Any&nbsp;losses&nbsp;disallowed&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;year&nbsp;due&nbsp;to the&nbsp;excess&nbsp;business&nbsp;loss&nbsp;limitation&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;used&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;member&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;following&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;year for up to eighty percent (80%) of computed taxable income if certain conditions are met. <br /> </p>
<p>Members to whom&nbsp;this&nbsp;excess&nbsp;business&nbsp;loss&nbsp;limitation&nbsp;applies&nbsp;will&nbsp;take&nbsp;their&nbsp;allocable&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;items of&nbsp;income,&nbsp;gain,&nbsp;loss&nbsp;and&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;into&nbsp;account&nbsp;in&nbsp;determining&nbsp;this&nbsp;limitation.&nbsp;This&nbsp;excess&nbsp;business&nbsp;loss limitation&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;applied&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-corporate&nbsp;member&nbsp;after&nbsp;the&nbsp;passive&nbsp;loss&nbsp;limitations&nbsp;and&nbsp;may&nbsp;limit&nbsp;such member&rsquo;s ability to use any losses EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> generates allocable to such member that are not otherwise&nbsp;limited&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;basis,&nbsp;at-risk&nbsp;and&nbsp;passive&nbsp;loss&nbsp;limitations&nbsp;described&nbsp;above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Limitations on Interest Deductions</strong><strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </strong></p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s ability to deduct interest on indebtedness allocable to its trade or business (excluding purchase&nbsp;interest)&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;limited&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;amount&nbsp;equal&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;sum&nbsp;of&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;business&nbsp;interest income&nbsp;during&nbsp;the&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;year&nbsp;and&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;30%&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;adjusted&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;income&nbsp;for&nbsp;such&nbsp;taxable year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> is not entitled to fully deduct business interest in any taxable year, such excess business interest expense will be allocated to each member as excess business interest and can&nbsp;be&nbsp;carried forward by the member to successive taxable years and used to offset any excess taxable income&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;by&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;to&nbsp;such&nbsp;member.&nbsp;Any&nbsp;excess&nbsp;business&nbsp;interest&nbsp;expense&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&nbsp;will&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;such&nbsp;member&rsquo;s&nbsp;tax&nbsp;basis&nbsp;in&nbsp;its&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;year&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;allocation&nbsp;even&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;expense&nbsp;does not give rise to a deduction to the member in that year. Immediately prior to a disposition of its&nbsp;digital assets,&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&rsquo;s&nbsp;tax&nbsp;basis&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;increased&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;amount&nbsp;by&nbsp;which&nbsp;such&nbsp;basis&nbsp;reduction&nbsp;exceeds&nbsp;the excess&nbsp;interest&nbsp;expense&nbsp;that&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;deducted&nbsp;by&nbsp;such&nbsp;member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prospective&nbsp;purchasers&nbsp;should&nbsp;consult their&nbsp;tax&nbsp;advisors&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;the&nbsp;impact&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;business&nbsp;interest&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;limitation&nbsp;on&nbsp;an investment&nbsp;in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the deductibility of a non-corporate taxpayer&rsquo;s &ldquo;purchase interest expense&rdquo; is generally limited&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;that&nbsp;taxpayer&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ldquo;net&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;income.&rdquo;&nbsp;Purchase&nbsp;interest&nbsp;expense&nbsp;includes: interest on indebtedness properly allocable to property held for purchase; (ii) interest expense attributed to portfolio income; and (iii) the portion of interest expense incurred to purchase or carry an interest in a passive activity to the extent attributable to portfolio income. The computation of a member&rsquo;s purchase interest expense will take into account interest on any margin account&nbsp;borrowing or other loan incurred to purchase or carry a Class A DIGITAL ASSET.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Net purchase income includes gross income from property held for purchase and amounts treated as portfolio income under the passive loss rules, less deductible expenses, other than interest, directly connected with the production of purchase income, but generally does not include gains attributable to the disposition of property held for purchase or (if applicable) qualified dividend income.&nbsp; Prospective&nbsp;purchasers&nbsp;should&nbsp;consult&nbsp;their&nbsp;tax&nbsp;advisors&nbsp;regarding the potential impact of the purchase interest expense limitation on an investment in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Limited Deductions for Activities Not Engaged in for Proﬁt</strong><strong>&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;take&nbsp;deductions&nbsp;for&nbsp;activities&nbsp;not&nbsp;engaged&nbsp;in&nbsp;for&nbsp;proﬁt&nbsp;is&nbsp;limited.&nbsp;The&nbsp;law&nbsp;presumes&nbsp;that&nbsp;an activity is engaged in for proﬁt if the gross income from the activity exceeds the deductions from the&nbsp;activity in at least three out of ﬁve consecutive years, ending with the tax year at issue. EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> intends to operate for the purpose of providing an economic proﬁt and anticipate that EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;will have sufficient income to entitle it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;beneﬁt&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;presumption&nbsp;that&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;operates&nbsp;for&nbsp;proﬁt. If&nbsp;the&nbsp;IRS&nbsp;were&nbsp;to&nbsp;treat&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;activities&nbsp;as&nbsp;not&nbsp;being&nbsp;engaged&nbsp;in&nbsp;for&nbsp;proﬁt,&nbsp;any&nbsp;deductions&nbsp;of&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;in&nbsp;excess&nbsp;of&nbsp;income&nbsp;might&nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permanently&nbsp;disallowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Itemized Deductions</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jobs&nbsp;Act&nbsp;suspends&nbsp;the&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;for&nbsp;miscellaneous&nbsp;itemized&nbsp;expenses&nbsp;and&nbsp;an&nbsp;overall limit on itemized deductions for taxable years beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31,&nbsp;2025.&nbsp;During these taxable years, non-corporate taxpayers will not be permitted to deduct miscellaneous itemized deductions, including their share of certain expenses incurred by EDGE196TM. Provided the suspension is not extended, for taxable&nbsp;years&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;on&nbsp;or&nbsp;after&nbsp;January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2026,&nbsp;such&nbsp;miscellaneous items will be deductible only to the extent they exceed 2% of the taxpayer&rsquo;s adjusted gross income (as they&nbsp;were&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;enactment&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jobs&nbsp;Act).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jobs&nbsp;Act&nbsp;also&nbsp;suspends&nbsp;the&nbsp;overall&nbsp;limitation&nbsp;on&nbsp;itemized&nbsp;deductions&nbsp;for&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;years beginning January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2025. Provided the suspension is not extended, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2026, such overall limitation on itemized deductions will be reduced by the lesser of (i) 3% of the excess of adjusted gross income over an &ldquo;applicable&nbsp;amount&rdquo; (ranging&nbsp;from&nbsp;$125,000&nbsp;to&nbsp;$300,000&nbsp;depending&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;identity&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;individual&nbsp;taxpayer),&nbsp;or&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;80%&nbsp;of the amount of the itemized deductions otherwise allowable for such taxable year (as it was prior to the enactment of the&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts and Jobs&nbsp;Act).&nbsp;<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Deduction for Qualiﬁed Business Income</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><br /> Under&nbsp;provisions&nbsp;recently&nbsp;passed&nbsp;by&nbsp;Congress&nbsp;as&nbsp;part&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jobs&nbsp;Act,&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an individual, estate or trust generally may&nbsp;deduct&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;20%&nbsp;of&nbsp;its&nbsp;qualiﬁed&nbsp;business&nbsp;income,&nbsp;which&nbsp;could include some income generated by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> and allocable to the member; provided, that, such&nbsp;deduction is subject to various limitations and restrictions, several of which are determined at the member level in light of such member&rsquo;s particular circumstances. Unless amended, this deduction applies only to taxable years beginning prior to December 31, 2025. Each prospective purchaser is encouraged to consult its own tax advisor in determining its eligibility to take such deduction with respect&nbsp;to&nbsp;income&nbsp;allocable&nbsp;to&nbsp;it&nbsp;from&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tax Rates</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under current&nbsp;law,&nbsp;the highest marginal U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to ordinary income of individuals is 37% and the highest U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to long-term capital&nbsp;gains&nbsp;(generally,&nbsp;capital&nbsp;gains&nbsp;on&nbsp;assets&nbsp;held&nbsp;for&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;12&nbsp;months)&nbsp;of&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;is&nbsp;20%.&nbsp;In&nbsp;addition,&nbsp;there is a 3.8% Medicare tax (&ldquo;NIIT&rdquo;) on net purchase income earned by certain individuals, estates and&nbsp;trusts. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult with their tax advisors as to the impact of the NIIT&nbsp;on an investment in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> anticipates earning capital gain income (short term and long term) and other&nbsp;passive&nbsp;streams of income such as dividend income. These streams of income and their source will retain&nbsp;their tax&nbsp;character&nbsp;as&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;to&nbsp;members.&nbsp;As&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;anticipates&nbsp;purchasing&nbsp;in&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;companies,&nbsp;it&nbsp;is possible&nbsp;that&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;tax&nbsp;resident&nbsp;members&nbsp;could&nbsp;be&nbsp;subject&nbsp;to&nbsp;deemed&nbsp;Subpart&nbsp;F&nbsp;or&nbsp;Global&nbsp;Intangible&nbsp;Low&nbsp;Taxable&nbsp;Income&nbsp;(&ldquo;GILTI&rdquo;)&nbsp;inclusions to the extent EDGE196<sup>TM </sup>owns 10% or more of an underlying foreign Fund&rsquo;s equity or profits interest and the foreign company is classified as a &nbsp;Controlled&nbsp;Foreign Corporation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;is&nbsp;required&nbsp;or&nbsp;elects&nbsp;under&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;law&nbsp;to&nbsp;pay&nbsp;any&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;federal,&nbsp;state,&nbsp;local&nbsp;or&nbsp;foreign income tax on behalf of any member or any former member, EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> may pay those taxes from Fund funds. That&nbsp;payment,&nbsp;if&nbsp;made,&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;of&nbsp;cash&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;member&nbsp;on&nbsp;whose behalf the payment was made. If the payment is made on behalf of a person whose identity cannot be determined,&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;treat&nbsp;the&nbsp;payment&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;to&nbsp;all&nbsp;current&nbsp;members.</p>
<p>Payments&nbsp;by&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;as&nbsp;described&nbsp;above&nbsp;could&nbsp;give&nbsp;rise&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;overpayment&nbsp;of&nbsp;tax&nbsp;on&nbsp;behalf&nbsp;of&nbsp;an individual member in which event the member would&nbsp;be&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;ﬁle&nbsp;a&nbsp;claim&nbsp;in&nbsp;order&nbsp;to&nbsp;obtain&nbsp;a&nbsp;credit for the taxes paid by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> or refund to the extent the tax withholdings exceed the&nbsp;member&rsquo;s&nbsp;tax liability&nbsp;amount.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Estimated Tax Payments</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A member may be required to make estimated tax payments due to his liability for paying the taxes on his distributive share of EDGE196TM&rsquo;s taxable income. EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> does not anticipate withholding or making payments to any taxing authority on behalf of its members. &nbsp;Nevertheless,&nbsp;there&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;some circumstances under which EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> is required to withhold on behalf of a member. For further&nbsp;information regarding the tax consequences of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s right or obligation to withhold or make&nbsp;a payment on your behalf, please consult your tax advisor. See&nbsp;also&nbsp;&ldquo;&mdash;Entity-Level&nbsp;Collections&rdquo;&nbsp;above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tax Consequences of Disposition</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon&nbsp;the&nbsp;sale,&nbsp;gift,&nbsp;transfer,&nbsp;assignment,&nbsp;or&nbsp;other&nbsp;disposition&nbsp;by&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&nbsp;of&nbsp;his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her&nbsp;digital assets,&nbsp;gain&nbsp;or&nbsp;loss recognized on a disposition of an interest in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> will be determined by calculating the difference between the amount received (or deemed received) and the selling member&rsquo;s adjusted&nbsp;basis in the digital assets sold.</p>
<p>Gain or loss recognized by a member on the sale of digital assets will generally be taxable as capital gain or capital loss. Capital gain recognized by an individual on the sale of digital assets held for more than&nbsp;12&nbsp;months&nbsp;will&nbsp;generally&nbsp;be&nbsp;taxed&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;federal&nbsp;income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;rate&nbsp;applicable&nbsp;to&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;capital gains.</p>
<p>However, a portion of this gain or loss, which could be substantial, will be separately computed and taxed as ordinary income or loss under Section &nbsp;751&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Code&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;extent&nbsp;attributable&nbsp;to&nbsp;assets giving rise to depreciation or depletion recapture or other &ldquo;unrealized receivables&rdquo; or to &nbsp;&ldquo;inventory&nbsp;items&rdquo; that EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> owns. Ordinary income attributable to unrealized receivables, inventory items and depreciation recapture may exceed net taxable gain realized upon the sale of a Class A DIGITAL ASSET and may be&nbsp;recognized even if there is a net taxable loss realized on the sale of an a Class A DIGITAL ASSET. Thus, a member may&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;both&nbsp;ordinary&nbsp;income&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;capital&nbsp;loss&nbsp;upon&nbsp;a&nbsp;sale&nbsp;of&nbsp;digital assets.&nbsp;Capital&nbsp;losses&nbsp;may&nbsp;offset&nbsp;capital gains&nbsp;and&nbsp;no&nbsp;more&nbsp;than&nbsp;$3,000&nbsp;of&nbsp;ordinary&nbsp;income&nbsp;each&nbsp;year,&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;case&nbsp;of&nbsp;individuals,&nbsp;and&nbsp;may&nbsp;only&nbsp;be used to offset capital gains in the case of corporations. Both ordinary income and capital&nbsp;gain recognized&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sale&nbsp;of&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;subject&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;additional&nbsp;Medicare&nbsp;tax&nbsp;in&nbsp;certain&nbsp;circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fund Tax Return and Audits</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> will be required to ﬁle federal and appropriate state annual partnership information income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;returns.&nbsp;In&nbsp;addition,&nbsp;each&nbsp;member&nbsp;will&nbsp;be&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;ﬁle&nbsp;his&nbsp;or&nbsp;her&nbsp;own&nbsp;personal&nbsp;federal,&nbsp;state or other income tax return reporting his or her share of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s income or loss, regardless of whether&nbsp;any&nbsp;distribution&nbsp;of&nbsp;cash&nbsp;is&nbsp;made&nbsp;to&nbsp;him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;will&nbsp;decide&nbsp;how&nbsp;to&nbsp;report&nbsp;the&nbsp;partnership items on EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s tax returns, consistent with the&nbsp;Limited Partnership&nbsp;Agreement. Given the uncertainty and&nbsp;complexity of the tax laws, it is possible that the IRS may not agree with the manner in which&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s items have been reported. In the event the income tax returns of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> are&nbsp;audited by the IRS, the tax treatment of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s income and deductions generally is determined at EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;level&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;single&nbsp;proceeding&nbsp;rather&nbsp;than&nbsp;by&nbsp;individual&nbsp;audits&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;members,&nbsp;although&nbsp;an&nbsp;audit of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s return may result in an audit of a member&rsquo;s return. The manager shall designate a &ldquo;partnership representative&rdquo; of EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> (the &ldquo;Partnership Representative&rdquo;) to represent EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> in U.S. federal income tax audits and the judicial review of any administrative adjustments made&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;IRS.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Partnership&nbsp;Representative&nbsp;has&nbsp;considerable&nbsp;authority&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;decisions&nbsp;affecting the tax treatment and procedural rights of all Members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among other things, the Partnership Representative has the authority to bind certain members to settlement agreements and the right on behalf of all members to extend the statute of limitations relating to the members&rsquo; tax liabilities with respect to Fund items. All&nbsp;members&nbsp;are&nbsp;generally&nbsp;required&nbsp;under&nbsp;the&nbsp;Code&nbsp;to&nbsp;treat&nbsp;the&nbsp;items&nbsp;on&nbsp;their own&nbsp;returns&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;with&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;return,&nbsp;unless&nbsp;they&nbsp;ﬁle&nbsp;a&nbsp;statement&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;IRS&nbsp;disclosing the&nbsp;inconsistency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> If&nbsp;the&nbsp;consistency&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;satisﬁed,&nbsp;the&nbsp;IRS&nbsp;may&nbsp;assess&nbsp;a&nbsp;deﬁciency&nbsp;against the member before audit proceedings are completed at EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> level. If a member fails to show properly on a return any amount that is shown on an information return, the member&rsquo;s failure may be treated&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;indication&nbsp;of&nbsp;negligence&nbsp;and&nbsp;subject&nbsp;to&nbsp;penalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Backup Withholding and Other Withholding</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;each&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;person&nbsp;purchaser&nbsp;is&nbsp;required&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;with&nbsp;an&nbsp;executed&nbsp;IRS&nbsp;Form&nbsp;W-9,&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> may nevertheless be unable to accurately or timely determine the tax status of the Fund&rsquo;s members for purposes of determining whether U.S. withholding applies to payments&nbsp;made by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> to some or all of the members. In such a case, payments made by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> to members who are individual citizens or residents of the United States may be subject to U.S. &ldquo;backup&rdquo; withholding at the applicable rate (currently 24%) or other U.S. withholding taxes&nbsp;(potentially&nbsp;as&nbsp;high&nbsp;as 30%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Such&nbsp;member&nbsp;would&nbsp;be&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;treat&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;credit&nbsp;its&nbsp;allocable&nbsp;share&nbsp;of&nbsp;any&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;withholding&nbsp;taxes paid in the taxable year in which such withholding taxes were paid and, as a result, such member may be&nbsp;entitled&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;refund&nbsp;of&nbsp;such&nbsp;taxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the&nbsp;event&nbsp;a&nbsp;member&nbsp;transfers&nbsp;or&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;disposes&nbsp;of&nbsp;some&nbsp;or all of its digital assets, special rules may apply for purposes of determining whether such member or the transferee of such digital assets is subject to U.S. withholding taxes in respect of income allocable to, or distributions made on account&nbsp;of,&nbsp;such digital assets&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;entitled to refunds of any such taxes withheld.&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Code&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1446(f)&nbsp;imposes&nbsp;a&nbsp;10%&nbsp;withholding&nbsp;tax&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;disposition&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;interest,&nbsp;unless the transferor receives a speciﬁed certiﬁcation from the transferee. Prospective purchasers are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the treatment of U.S. withholding taxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Minimum Tax</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some taxpayers must pay an &ldquo;alternative minimum tax&rdquo; (&ldquo;AMT&rdquo;) if the AMT exceeds the taxpayer&rsquo;s regular federal income tax liability for the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For non-corporate taxpayers, the AMT is imposed on &ldquo;altervative minimum taxable income&rdquo; (&ldquo;AMTI&rdquo;) that is above an exeption amount.&nbsp; The&nbsp;AMTI&nbsp;is&nbsp;based on a different computation of taxable income, which is increased by tax preference items, and other&nbsp;adjustments to taxable income are made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts and Jobs Act, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, temporarily increases both the AMT exemption&nbsp;amount and&nbsp;the&nbsp;phase-out&nbsp;of&nbsp;AMT&nbsp;exemption&nbsp;amount.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jobs&nbsp;Act&nbsp;repeals&nbsp;the&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;AMT&nbsp;for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. However, the&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Cuts and Jobs Act continues to allow prior year minimum tax credits to offset a corporate taxpayer&rsquo;s regular tax liability for any tax year. For tax years beginning after 2017 and before 2022, with respect to corporate taxpayers, the prior year minimum tax credit is refundable in an amount equal to 50% (100% for tax years beginning in 2021) of the excess of the credit for the tax year over the amount of the credit allowable for the year against regular tax liability. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors as to the possible AMT consequences of purchasing in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transferor/Transferee Allocations</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> may allocate items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit using a monthly or other convention, whereby any such items recognized in a given month by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> are allocated to&nbsp;the holders of our digital assets as of a speciﬁed date of such month. As a result, if a member transfers digital assets, such member may be allocated income, gain, loss and deduction realized by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> after the date of transfer. Similarly, if a member acquires additional digital assets, such member may be allocated income,&nbsp;gain, loss,&nbsp;and&nbsp;deduction&nbsp;realized&nbsp;by&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to&nbsp;such&nbsp;member&rsquo;s&nbsp;ownership&nbsp;of&nbsp;such&nbsp;digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Section&nbsp;706&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;Internal&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;Code&nbsp;generally&nbsp;provides&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;for&nbsp;allocations&nbsp;of&nbsp;items&nbsp;of partnership income and deductions between transferors and transferees of partnership digital assets, the IRS&nbsp;could&nbsp;disagree&nbsp;with&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;conventions&nbsp;and&nbsp;contend&nbsp;that&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;taxable&nbsp;income&nbsp;or losses must be reallocated among the members. If such a contention were sustained, the members&rsquo; respective&nbsp;tax&nbsp;liabilities&nbsp;would&nbsp;be&nbsp;adjusted,&nbsp;possibly&nbsp;to&nbsp;their&nbsp;detriment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tax Shelter Registration and Reportable Transactions</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Code&nbsp;imposes&nbsp;disclosure&nbsp;and&nbsp;list&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;obligations&nbsp;for&nbsp;persons&nbsp;that&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in&nbsp;listed&nbsp;and&nbsp;reportable transactions. In general, listed and reportable transactions are those that the IRS views as having substantial potential for tax avoidance or evasion. By category, reportable transactions include listed transactions, conﬁdential transactions, transactions with contractual protection, transactions that result in substantial losses,&nbsp;and&nbsp;transactions&nbsp;of&nbsp;interest.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;Regulation&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.6011-4(b)(1) deﬁnes &ldquo;transaction&rdquo; as including&nbsp;&ldquo;all&nbsp;of the factual elements relevant to the expected tax treatment of any purchase, entity, plan, or arrangement, and includes any series of steps carried out as part of a plan.&rdquo;&nbsp;If&nbsp;an investment&nbsp;in&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;or&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;speciﬁc&nbsp;asset&nbsp;or&nbsp;group of assets were considered to be a reportable transaction, then EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s members would be required&nbsp;to&nbsp;adequately&nbsp;disclose&nbsp;such&nbsp;transactions&nbsp;on&nbsp;their&nbsp;income&nbsp;tax&nbsp;return&nbsp;and&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;would&nbsp;be required to disclose such transactions on its information return. EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> does not expect that,&nbsp;under current Treasury Regulations, an investment in EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s digital assets or EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&rsquo;s purchases in assets will constitute reportable&nbsp;transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy-Related Penalties</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain&nbsp;additional&nbsp;penalties&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;imposed&nbsp;on&nbsp;taxpayers&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result&nbsp;of&nbsp;an&nbsp;underpayment&nbsp;of&nbsp;tax&nbsp;that&nbsp;is attributable to one or more specific causes,&nbsp;including:&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;negligence&nbsp;or&nbsp;disregard&nbsp;of&nbsp;rules&nbsp;or&nbsp;regulations, (i) substantial understatements of income tax, (iii) substantial valuation misstatements and (iv) the disallowance&nbsp;of&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;tax&nbsp;beneﬁts&nbsp;by&nbsp;reason&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;transaction&nbsp;lacking&nbsp;economic&nbsp;substance&nbsp;or&nbsp;failing&nbsp;to meet&nbsp;the&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;of&nbsp;any&nbsp;similar&nbsp;rule&nbsp;of&nbsp;law.&nbsp;Except&nbsp;with&nbsp;respect&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;disallowance&nbsp;of&nbsp;claimed&nbsp;tax beneﬁts by reason of a transaction lacking economic substance or failing to meet the requirements of any similar rule of&nbsp;law,&nbsp;however, no penalty will be imposed for any portion of any such underpayment if it is shown that there was a reasonable cause for the underpayment of that portion and that the taxpayer acted in good faith regarding the underpayment of that portion. With respect to substantial&nbsp;understatements of income tax, the amount of any understatement subject to penalty generally is reduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to a position adopted on the&nbsp;return: (A) for which there is, or was, &ldquo;substantial authority&rdquo;; or (B) as to which there is a reasonable basis&nbsp;and the relevant facts of that position are adequately disclosed on the return.&nbsp;Taxpayers&nbsp;must pay interest on&nbsp;any&nbsp;underpayment&nbsp;of&nbsp;tax,&nbsp;which&nbsp;interest&nbsp;is&nbsp;subject&nbsp;to&nbsp;compounding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Aspects</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prospective purchasers should recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;may&nbsp;be&nbsp;modiﬁed&nbsp;by&nbsp;legislative,&nbsp;judicial&nbsp;or&nbsp;administrative&nbsp;action&nbsp;at&nbsp;any&nbsp;time&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;any&nbsp;such action may affect purchases and commitments previously made.</p>
<p>The rules dealing with&nbsp;federal&nbsp;income&nbsp;taxation&nbsp;are&nbsp;constantly&nbsp;under&nbsp;review&nbsp;by&nbsp;persons&nbsp;involved&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;legislative&nbsp;process,&nbsp;the&nbsp;IRS,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Treasury&nbsp;Department,&nbsp;resulting&nbsp;in&nbsp;revisions&nbsp;of&nbsp;regulations&nbsp;and&nbsp;revised&nbsp;interpretations&nbsp;of&nbsp;established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely&nbsp;affect&nbsp;the&nbsp;tax&nbsp;aspects&nbsp;of&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;in&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tax&nbsp;Treatment&nbsp;of&nbsp;Trusts,&nbsp;Estates,&nbsp;Tax-Exempt&nbsp;Organizations, Foreign Persons, and&nbsp;Person&rsquo;s&nbsp;Subject to Specialized&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Rules</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tax treatment of trusts, estates, foreign persons, and person&rsquo;s subject to specialized tax rules can differ materially from the tax treatment of U.S. tax resident individuals. Such prospective purchasers should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the applicability of the tax rules discussed in this section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All&nbsp;purchasers&nbsp;will&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;with&nbsp;identiﬁcation&nbsp;documentation&nbsp;allowing&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM </sup>and member purchaser to comply with Foreign&nbsp;Account&nbsp;Tax&nbsp;Compliance&nbsp;Act.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foreign purchasers will be subject to quarterly withholding requirements wherein EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> will be&nbsp;required to pay the associated U.S. tax liability with regard to any allocable U.S. effectively connected income (ECI) earned by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;is&nbsp;engaged&nbsp;[in&nbsp;a&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;trade&nbsp;or&nbsp;business],&nbsp;a&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;non-U.S.&nbsp;person&nbsp;member&nbsp;will&nbsp;also&nbsp;be deemed engaged in that underlying trade or business&nbsp;requiring&nbsp;the&nbsp;ﬁling&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;U.S.&nbsp;tax&nbsp;return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Purchasers</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The federal income tax consequences to purchasers that are corporations may differ materially from the tax consequences discussed in this section.&nbsp;Such&nbsp;prospective&nbsp;purchasers&nbsp;should&nbsp;consult&nbsp;with&nbsp;their&nbsp;own&nbsp;tax advisors&nbsp;as&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;tax&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;to&nbsp;them&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>State, Local, Foreign, and Other Tax Considerations</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to U.S. federal income taxes, you and EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> may be subject to other taxes, such as state, local, and foreign income and withholding taxes, unincorporated business taxes, and estate, inheritance, or intangible taxes that may be imposed by the various jurisdictions in which EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> does&nbsp;business&nbsp;or&nbsp;owns&nbsp;property&nbsp;or&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;you&nbsp;are&nbsp;a&nbsp;resident.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;jurisdictions&nbsp;may&nbsp;require&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>, or EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> may elect, to withhold a percentage of income from amounts to be distributed to a member who is not a resident of the jurisdiction. Withholding, the amount of which&nbsp;may be greater or less than a particular member&rsquo;s income tax liability to the jurisdiction, generally does not relieve a nonresident member from the obligation to ﬁle an income tax return. Amounts withheld will&nbsp;be treated as if distributed to members for purposes of determining the amounts distributed by EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> If EDGE196<sup>TM</sup> pays tax to a foreign jurisdiction, members may be eligible for a foreign tax credit as relating to a member&rsquo;s allocable share of the income and underlying associated tax.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This summary does not address the state, local, foreign, and other tax consequences of owning or disposing&nbsp;of&nbsp;digital assets&nbsp;in&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;accordingly,&nbsp;each&nbsp;prospective&nbsp;purchaser&nbsp;is&nbsp;urged&nbsp;to&nbsp;consult&nbsp;with&nbsp;its own tax advisors regarding the state, local, foreign, and&nbsp;other&nbsp;tax&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;of&nbsp;an investment&nbsp;in&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;of&nbsp;each&nbsp;member&nbsp;to&nbsp;investigate&nbsp;the&nbsp;legal&nbsp;and&nbsp;tax&nbsp;consequences,&nbsp;under&nbsp;the&nbsp;laws of pertinent states, localities and foreign &nbsp;jurisdictions,&nbsp;of&nbsp;an investment&nbsp;in&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, each prospective purchaser is urged to consult his own tax counsel or other advisor with regard to those matters. Further, it is the responsibility of each member to ﬁle all state, local and foreign, as well as U.S. federal tax returns, that may be required of&nbsp;him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> THE&nbsp;TAX&nbsp;DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS FOR GENERAL&nbsp;INFORMATION&nbsp;ONLY&nbsp;AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO DESCRIBE FULLY THE TAX CONSEQUENCES&nbsp;OF&nbsp;AN&nbsp;PURCHASE&nbsp;IN&nbsp;EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /> A PURCHASE IN EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;COULD&nbsp;RESULT&nbsp;IN SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE&nbsp;TAX&nbsp;CONSEQUENCES FOR MEMBERS, WHICH ARE&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;DISCUSSED HEREIN. PRIOR&nbsp;TO&nbsp;PURCHASING IN EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>,&nbsp;PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD&nbsp;CONSULT&nbsp;THEIR&nbsp;TAX&nbsp;ADVISERS&nbsp;REGARDING THE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES&nbsp;OF&nbsp;PURCHASING,&nbsp;HOLDING,&nbsp;AND&nbsp;DISPOSING&nbsp;OF&nbsp;DIGITAL ASSETS OF EDGE196<sup>TM</sup>&nbsp;UNDER U.S. FEDERAL,&nbsp;STATE,&nbsp;LOCAL, AND NON-U.S.&nbsp;TAX&nbsp;LAW&nbsp;AND ANY PROPOSED&nbsp;TAX&nbsp;LAW&nbsp;CHANGES.</p>
